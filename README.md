This Kotlin Multiplatform project demonstrates a cross-platform music player implemented for Android, iOS, and Web.
The audio source used in the application is publicly available online from SoundHelix.
All core playback functionalities (Play, Pause, Stop) work consistently across platforms.
On iOS, the seek functionality is fully operational, although the progress slider does not yet visually update in real time.
The Android and Web versions support smooth playback and control interaction, with further improvements planned for synchronization and seek feedback in future updates.
